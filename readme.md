# Top-level design

# Deployment

## Deploy mongodb

```shell
sam build -t template-dynamodb.yaml --config-file samconfig-dynamodb.toml

sam deploy -t template-dynamodb.yaml --config-file samconfig-dynamodb.toml
```

# Serverless Compatibility

The project is only compatible with AWS lambda nowadays

- [x] aws lambda

# Notes

## Why not to use JetBrains Kotless directly?

[JetBrains kotless](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotless) is a kotlin-based serverless framework.
From the perspective of mine, it is more like an infrastructure deployment tool/framework rather than a serverless
lib. I would like to choose one lib as sidecar of the project. So I extract part of code which is related with ktor
serverless from JetBrains kotless into folder `src/main/kotlin/com/ivyxjc/kotless`.

There is another factor to be considered that kotless does not support AWS ApiGateway V2 HttpApi.
